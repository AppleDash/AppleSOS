Place drivers in here eventually.

Some directories to maybe make:

- pci (PCI host controllers)
- usb (Actual USB controllers, not like keyboard/mouse)
- input (Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, etc)
- comm (if you want a more 'unified' communication subsystem/layer/etc)
    - comm/eth
    - comm/modem
    - comm/fc (FibreChannel)
    - etc..
- arch (Architecture-specific devices; OpenFirmware console on ppc/sparc, EFI on x86/Itanium)
